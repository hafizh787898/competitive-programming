# competitive-programming
My solutions to various online judges &amp; programming contests 

It's been years since the last time I dove into competitive programming (it was back in highschool), so these code are pretty old.

Note: I am too lazy to refactor some coding style in my old codes that usually has ugly format (ex: no spaces among operators, bad indentation, etc). So it will be harder to read those code.
